# employee-tracker-challenge

- obstacle: having to use "import" instead of "require" for inquirer. No idea why, but troubleshooted successfully. Then figured out how to use require again.

- at first I thought we needed express, but then I realized using console.table package is being used in place of express

- figuring out mySQL query syntax was quite a challenge, especially trying to reference the employee Id as the manager id. The usage of a "qualifier letter" helped out here by distinguishing the managers.

- each prompt response is its own little challenge. made this assignment interesting
